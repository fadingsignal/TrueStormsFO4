Version 2.0
	This is a maintenance, clean-up, and installer update, no urgent need to update if you are mid-game currently.
	ALL plugins besides main ESM are now ESP-FE (ESL-flagged ESPs!) freeing up load order slots.
	FOMOD has been updated to include all DLC and options; no more confusion or manual steps.
	All DLC add-ons re-worked for better patching.
	Dust storms no longer take place in the Commonwealth. These are now in Nuka-World only.
	Vanilla weather chances option updated for Far Harbor and Nuka-World.
	Vanilla weather chances + earlier sunsets patches added.
	Minor cleanup throughout.
	Major version increment to 2.0 due to Far Harbor and Nuka-World being compacted and turned into ESP-FE which "breaks" prior versions.
	True Storms effects are now ON by default. Open holotape to further tweak, enable ghoul attacks, etc.
